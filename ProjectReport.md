<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<br>

The increasing complexity and frequency of network attacks necessitate efficient and intelligent vulnerability assessment tools. Traditional signature-based methods often struggle with novel or obfuscated threats. This project explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for network packet vulnerability assessment, specifically focusing on resource-constrained environments. We leverage the TinyLlama-1.1B model, known for its efficiency, fine-tuned locally on a curated dataset covering the top 5 common network vulnerabilities: SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Buffer Overflow, Denial-of-Service (DoS/DDoS), and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. The project involves developing a comprehensive data collection plan using sources like OWASP, NIST, CVE databases, CTF writeups, and open-source playbooks. A detailed procedure for transforming this raw data into a structured JSONL format suitable for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is presented, emphasizing Question-Answer pair generation for detection and mitigation tasks. The fine-tuning process incorporates resource optimization techniques like QLoRA, gradient accumulation, and efficient data handling. The core application analyzes network traffic (PCAP files and potentially live streams) using a hybrid approach, combining a fast rule-based engine with the fine-tuned TinyLlama model for deeper analysis. The system outputs structured reports identifying potential vulnerabilities, their severity, supporting evidence, and actionable mitigation steps tailored for enterprise environments. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using smaller, efficiently fine-tuned LLMs for practical network security tasks, even under significant resource limitations.

| Approach                     | Pros                                                                 | Cons                                                                                                |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Signature-Based            | Fast, Low False Positives for known threats, Mature technology        | Cannot detect zero-day/unknown threats, Requires constant signature updates, Easily bypassed by obfuscation |
| Anomaly-Based              | Can detect novel threats, Does not rely on specific signatures        | High False Positive rate, Difficult to establish accurate baseline, Can be evaded by slow attacks     |
| SAST/DAST                    | Finds vulnerabilities in code/apps directly                           | Not real-time network detection, SAST has high FP, DAST has limited coverage                       |
| LLM (General Security Use) | Potential for understanding context, Summarization, Code analysis | Computationally expensive, Requires specific fine-tuning, Prone to hallucination, Explainability issues |
| **This Project (Hybrid)**    | **Combines speed of rules with LLM context (potential), Targets common vulns, Aims for efficiency (TinyLlama)** | **LLM effectiveness depends heavily on fine-tuning, Resource constraints limit LLM complexity/speed, Potential for both FP/FN** |

## **2.5 Issues/Observations from Investigation**

# **CHAPTER 3: REQUIREMENT ARTIFACTS**

## **3.1 Introduction**

[Introduce the chapter, stating its purpose is to define the specific requirements for the project.]

## **3.2 Hardware and Software Requirements**

### **3.2.1 Hardware Requirements (Development/Execution)**

*   **Processor:** Multi-core CPU (e.g., AMD Ryzen 5 4500U or equivalent/better recommended)
*   **RAM:** Minimum 8GB RAM (More is highly recommended, especially if attempting local fine-tuning or analysis of very large files). 16GB+ preferred.
*   **Storage:** Sufficient disk space for OS, Python environment, dependencies, LLM base model (~2-3GB for TinyLlama), fine-tuned adapter (~100-300MB), datasets, and logs (Recommend 50GB+ free space).
*   **GPU (Optional but Highly Recommended for LLM):** NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (e.g., GTX 16xx, RTX series) with sufficient VRAM (minimum 4GB VRAM for inference with TinyLlama using quantization, 6GB+ preferred; Training requires significantly more, likely 8GB+ even with QLoRA).

### **3.2.2 Software Requirements**

*   **Operating System:** Linux (Recommended, e.g., Ubuntu 20.04+), macOS, or Windows (WSL2 recommended for Linux compatibility).
*   **Python:** Version 3.9 or higher.
*   **Core Libraries:** (List key libraries from `requirements.txt`)
    *   `torch`, `transformers`, `accelerate`, `datasets`, `peft`, `trl`, `bitsandbytes` (for LLM)
    *   `scapy` (for packet processing)
    *   `click` (for CLI)
    *   `PyYAML`, `python-docx`, `PyPDF2`/`pymupdf` (for data processing)
*   **System Tools:** `libpcap-dev` (Linux) or `Npcap` (Windows) for Scapy live capture. Git.

## **3.3 Specific Project Requirements**

### **3.3.1 Functional Requirements**

*   FR1: The system shall analyze network packet data from PCAP/PCAPNG files.
*   FR2: The system shall (optionally, with sufficient privileges) capture and analyze live network traffic from a specified interface.
*   FR3: The system shall implement a rule-based engine to detect predefined network patterns or signatures related to vulnerabilities.
*   FR4: The system shall integrate with a fine-tuned TinyLlama-1.1B LLM to perform vulnerability analysis on packet features.
*   FR5: The system shall identify potential instances of the following vulnerabilities: SQL Injection, XSS, Buffer Overflow, DoS/DDoS indicators, MitM indicators.
*   FR6: The system shall generate a severity level (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational) for each identified finding.
*   FR7: The system shall generate actionable mitigation steps corresponding to the identified finding (either rule-based or LLM-generated).
*   FR8: The system shall produce structured output reports (JSON format) detailing findings.
*   FR9: The system shall provide a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction, including specifying input (file/interface), output file, model adapter path, and toggling LLM analysis.
*   FR10: The system shall include scripts and instructions for fine-tuning the TinyLlama-1.1B model using a provided dataset format (JSONL).

### **3.3.2 Non-Functional Requirements**

*   NFR1: **Resource Efficiency:** The system (especially inference) should be designed to operate within the constraints of a typical modern laptop (target: 8GB RAM, moderate CPU), prioritizing efficiency when the LLM is used. *Fine-tuning will likely require more resources or cloud platforms.*
*   NFR2: **Performance:** Rule-based analysis should be performed quickly. PCAP processing should handle moderately large files efficiently (iterative processing). LLM inference time per packet/feature set should be minimized through model choice and potential optimizations (acknowledging it will still be slower than rules).
*   NFR3: **Modularity:** The code structure shall be modular (data processing, training, rules, LLM interface, assessment logic, CLI) to facilitate maintenance and extension.
*   NFR4: **Usability:** The CLI shall be user-friendly with clear commands, options, and informative output.
*   NFR5: **Accuracy:** The system should strive for reasonable accuracy in identifying the target vulnerabilities, balancing false positives and false negatives (effectiveness heavily dependent on rule quality and LLM fine-tuning).

### **3.3.3 Data Requirements**

*   DR1: The fine-tuning dataset shall cover examples related to the 5 target vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, BoF, DoS/DDoS, MitM).
*   DR2: The dataset shall include examples of vulnerability descriptions, detection patterns/indicators (textualized), impacts, and mitigation steps.
*   DR3: The dataset shall be structured in JSONL format with `instruction`, `input`, and `output` keys suitable for SFTTrainer and the TinyLlama Chat format.

**(Chapter 4)**

# **CHAPTER 4: DESIGN METHODOLOGY AND ITS NOVELTY**

## **4.1 Methodology and Goal**

[Describe the overall approach: A hybrid system combining a fast, deterministic rule-based engine with a flexible, context-aware LLM (TinyLlama-1.1B). The goal is to leverage the strengths of both – rules for known patterns and speed, LLM for potentially more nuanced analysis and mitigation generation – while optimizing for resource constraints. The methodology involves data curation, focused fine-tuning, modular implementation, and CLI-based interaction.]

## **4.2 Functional Modules Design and Analysis**

[Diagram or describe the core modules and their interactions.]

### **4.2.1 Data Collection & Preprocessing Module**

*   **Design:** Scripts (`ingest.py`, `text_processor.py`, etc.) or a pipeline (`data_pipeline.py`) to gather data from diverse sources (web, files, PCAPs). Uses libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `PyPDF2`, `python-docx`, `PyYAML`, `scapy`.
*   **Analysis:** Extracts relevant text, structures it, converts technical info (packets, rule logic) into descriptive text suitable for LLM input and QA pair generation (`transform.py`). Focus on local processing viability.

### **4.2.2 LLM Fine-Tuning Module (`src/llm_training/`)**

*   **Design:** Uses `transformers`, `peft`, `trl`, `bitsandbytes`. Implements SFTTrainer workflow (`train.py`) with QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning. Utilizes `utils.py` for data loading and ChatML prompt formatting.
*   **Analysis:** Optimized for low-resource training attempts via QLoRA, gradient accumulation, checkpointing. Aims to specialize TinyLlama on the 5 target vulnerabilities and mitigation generation in the desired JSON format.

### **4.2.3 Packet Capture & Feature Extraction Module (`src/vulnerability_assessment/feature_extractor.py`)**

*   **Design:** Uses `scapy` for parsing packets (live or PCAP). Extracts key L2-L4 header fields (MACs, IPs, Ports, Flags, Proto) and limited payload snippets (bytes and decoded text). Includes basic DNS parsing.
*   **Analysis:** Prioritizes essential features relevant to common vulnerabilities. Avoids deep packet inspection of complex encrypted protocols locally for performance. Designed to feed structured data to both the Rule Engine and the LLM Interface.

### **4.2.4 Rule Engine Module (`src/vulnerability_assessment/rules.py`)**

*   **Design:** Class-based engine (`RuleEngine`, `Rule`). Stores rules with ID, description, severity, check function, and mitigation steps. Check functions operate on the feature dictionary from the extractor. Designed for easy addition of new rules. Loads default rules for the 5 target vulns.
*   **Analysis:** Provides fast initial checks for known patterns (bad IPs, insecure ports, basic signatures). Reduces load on the LLM. Findings are formatted consistently.

### **4.2.5 LLM Inference Interface Module (`src/vulnerability_assessment/llm_interface.py`)**

*   **Design:** Manages loading the base TinyLlama model and applying the fine-tuned PEFT adapter. Caches the loaded model. Formats the input features into the ChatML prompt structure. Sends requests to the model, handles generation parameters. Parses and validates the expected JSON output from the LLM response.
*   **Analysis:** Optimized to load model/adapter efficiently. Robust JSON parsing is critical. Handles interaction with the potentially resource-constrained model.

### **4.2.6 Reporting Module (`assess.py` functions)**

*   **Design:** Functions within `assess.py` (`format_report`, `save_report`, `print_summary`) take findings (from rules or LLM) and features to create standardized JSON reports. Handles saving to file or printing a console summary.
*   **Analysis:** Ensures consistent report structure regardless of detection source. Provides user-readable output options.

### **4.2.7 Command-Line Interface (CLI) Module (`src/cli/cli.py`)**

*   **Design:** Uses the `click` library to create a structured CLI with commands (`assess pcap`, `assess live`) and options (`--file`, `--interface`, `--model`, `--output`, `--no-llm`, `--log-level`). Orchestrates calls to the assessment module (`assess.py`).
*   **Analysis:** Provides a clear, standard way for users to interact with the tool and configure analysis parameters.

## **4.3 Software Architectural Designs**

[Describe the architecture. Likely a **Modular Monolith** for this scope.
*   **Presentation Layer:** CLI (`cli.py`).
*   **Application Logic Layer:** Assessment Orchestration (`assess.py`), Rule Engine (`rules.py`), LLM Interface (`llm_interface.py`).
*   **Data Access/Processing Layer:** Feature Extractor (`feature_extractor.py`), Fine-tuning Data Prep (`llm_training/utils.py`).
*   **External Dependencies:** Scapy, Transformers/PyTorch/PEFT/TRL/BitsAndBytes.
Mention the data flow: CLI -> Assess -> Feature Extractor -> Rule Engine -> (Optional) LLM Interface -> Assess (Formatting) -> CLI (Output).]

## **4.4 Subsystem Services (if applicable)**

[Likely not applicable for this initial CLI-based design. Could mention future potential for API services if scaling.]

## **4.5 User Interface Designs**

[Focus on the CLI design. Describe the main commands, options, and expected output formats (console summary table, JSON file output, JSON Lines for live logging). Include example command usage.]
*   `python src/cli/cli.py assess pcap -f <file> -m <adapter_path> -o <report.json>`
*   `sudo python src/cli/cli.py assess live -i <interface> -m <adapter_path> -l <live.jsonl>`
*   `python src/cli/cli.py assess pcap -f <file> --no-llm`

## **4.6 Summary**

[Summarize the chosen hybrid design methodology, the key functional modules, the modular architecture, and the CLI-focused user interface, emphasizing the design choices made to accommodate resource constraints and the specific project goals.]

**(Chapter 5)**

# **CHAPTER 5: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION & ANALYSIS**

## **5.1 Outline**

[Briefly state that this chapter details the implementation of the core modules described in the design chapter, presents code snippets, shows CLI usage, and discusses testing.]

## **5.2 Technical Coding and Code Solutions**

[Reference the actual Python files provided in the previous answers. Include selected, illustrative snippets *here* in the report, with explanations.]

### **5.2.1 Rule Engine (`rules.py`)**

```python
# Snippet from rules.py - Rule Definition and Check
class Rule:
    # ... (init as before) ...
    def check(self, features: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        # ... (try-except block as before) ...

# Snippet - Example Rule Check Function
def check_syn_scan_port(f: Dict[str, Any], target_port: int) -> bool:
     flags = f.get("tcp_flags", "") # Expects flags as string "S", "SA" etc.
     return (f.get("protocol") == "TCP" and
             f.get("dst_port") == target_port and
             flags == "S") # SYN flag ONLY
```
*Explanation:* The RuleEngine uses Rule objects containing check functions. Rules like `SCAN_SMB_SYN_01` use lambda functions to pass specific parameters (target port) to generic check logic, promoting code reuse. Checks operate directly on the feature dictionary.

### **5.2.2 Feature Extraction (`feature_extractor.py`)**

```python
# Snippet from feature_extractor.py - Core Extraction Logic
def extract_features_from_packet(#...):
    # ... (Initialize features dict) ...
    try:
        # L2 Extraction (Ether)
        # ...
        # L3 Extraction (IP/IPv6)
        if IP in packet: #...
        elif IPv6 in packet: #...
        else: return None # Ignore non-IP
        # ...
        # L4 Extraction (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
        if TCP in packet: #... features["tcp_flags"] = str(transport_layer.flags)
        elif UDP in packet:
             # ...
             # DNS Parsing (if UDP port 53)
             if DNS in packet: #... extract qname/response IPs ...
        elif ICMP in packet: #...
        else: features["protocol"] = f"IP_Proto_{features['protocol_num']}"
        # ...
        # Payload Extraction
        # ... (find payload bytes) ...
        if payload_bytes:
            features["payload_bytes"] = payload_bytes[:MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES_LEN]
            features["payload_snippet"] = _safe_payload_decode(payload_bytes[:MAX_PAYLOAD_SNIPPET_LEN])
        # ...
        return features
    except Exception as e: #... log error, return None ...
```
*Explanation:* Uses Scapy layers to dissect packets. Prioritizes key L2-L4 fields. Includes basic DNS parsing and safe payload extraction (raw bytes and decoded snippet). Handles common Scapy exceptions and returns `None` for irrelevant packets.

### **5.2.3 LLM Interface (`llm_interface.py`)**

```python
# Snippet from llm_interface.py - Model Loading & Query
_loaded_model = None # ... (global caches) ...

def load_llm_model_with_adapter(#...):
    # ... (Checks cache, clears old model, determines device/dtype) ...
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(base_model_name_or_path, **model_load_kwargs)
    # ... (Load tokenizer) ...
    if adapter_path_str:
        model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, adapter_path_str)
    # ... (Cache model, tokenizer, adapter_path) ...

@torch.no_grad()
def query_llm(features: Dict[str, Any], adapter_path: Optional[str | Path] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # ... (Ensure model loaded via load_llm_model_with_adapter) ...
    prompt = create_llm_prompt(features) # Uses ChatML format
    inputs = _loaded_tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt", #...).to(_llm_device)
    generation_config = GenerationConfig(#...)
    output_ids = _loaded_model.generate(**inputs, generation_config=generation_config)
    full_output_text = _loaded_tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=False)
    parsed_json = extract_json_output(full_output_text, prompt) # Robust JSON extraction
    # ... (Return parsed_json or error dict) ...
```
*Explanation:* Manages loading the base TinyLlama model and applying PEFT adapters, caching the result. Formats input features into the required ChatML prompt. Performs inference using `model.generate()` and robustly parses the expected JSON from the output stream.

### **5.2.4 Assessment Orchestration (`assess.py`)**

```python
# Snippet from assess.py - _process_single_packet
def _process_single_packet(#... rule_engine, llm_adapter_path, analyze_with_llm ...):
    # ... (Extract features using feature_extractor) ...
    if not features: return None
    # Check rules first
    rule_finding = rule_engine.check_packet(features)
    if rule_finding:
        return format_report(features, rule_finding, is_llm_finding=False)
    # Query LLM if enabled and no rule hit
    if analyze_with_llm:
        llm_analysis = llm_interface.query_llm(features, adapter_path=llm_adapter_path)
        if llm_analysis.get("is_vulnerable"):
            return format_report(features, llm_analysis, is_llm_finding=True)
        elif "error" in llm_analysis: # Log LLM errors
            logger.error(...)
    return None # No finding

# Snippet - assess_pcap using PcapReader
def assess_pcap(#... rule_engine, model_adapter_path, analyze_with_llm ...):
    # ... (Pre-load LLM if analyze_with_llm) ...
    with PcapReader(str(pcap_file_path)) as pcap_reader:
        for packet in pcap_reader:
            # ... (Call _process_single_packet) ...
            # ... (Append finding if not None) ...
            # ... (Log progress) ...
    # ... (Return all_findings) ...
```
*Explanation:* Orchestrates the analysis flow. Uses `PcapReader` for efficient file handling. The `_process_single_packet` function encapsulates the core logic: extract features, check rules, optionally query LLM, format report.

### **5.2.5 CLI Implementation (`cli.py`)**

```python
# Snippet from cli.py - Defining a command
@assess_cmd.command('pcap', short_help="Analyze a PCAP file.")
@click.option('--file', '-f', 'pcap_file', # ... type=Path ... )
@click.option('--output', '-o', # ... type=Path ... )
@add_options(common_options) # Decorator for shared --model, --no-llm options
@click.pass_context
def pcap_analysis(ctx, pcap_file, output, model_adapter_path, no_llm, rules_first):
    # ... (Instantiate RuleEngine) ...
    # ... (Determine analyze_with_llm flag) ...
    # ... (User feedback via click.echo) ...
    try:
        results = assess.assess_pcap(
            pcap_file_path=pcap_file,
            rule_engine=rule_engine,
            model_adapter_path=model_adapter_path, # Pass Path or None
            analyze_with_llm=analyze_with_llm
        )
        # ... (Handle results: save report or print summary) ...
    except Exception as e:
        # ... (Handle errors, print to click.echo(err=True), exit) ...
```
*Explanation:* Uses `click` decorators to define commands and options. Parses arguments, instantiates the `RuleEngine`, calls the appropriate `assess` function, and handles displaying output or saving reports, along with user feedback and error handling.

### **5.2.6 Fine-tuning Scripts (`train.py`, `utils.py`)**

[Refer to the complete code provided in the previous answers for `src/llm_training/train.py` and `src/llm_training/utils.py`. Key features: SFTTrainer, QLoRA, gradient accumulation, ChatML formatting.]
*Explanation:* `utils.py` handles loading the JSONL data and formatting it into the ChatML structure. `train.py` uses `SFTTrainer` from `trl` along with `peft` and `bitsandbytes` to perform efficient fine-tuning (QLoRA) on the prepared dataset, saving the resulting adapter.

## **5.4 Prototype Submission**

[Describe the state of the submitted code. Mention that it includes the core functionalities: CLI, data prep scripts, fine-tuning script, rule engine, feature extraction, LLM interface, and assessment orchestration. State that a fine-tuned adapter (e.g., `models/tinyllama_1.1b_chat_vuln_adapter`) might be provided separately or instructions given on how to train it. Mention known limitations (e.g., limited rule set, dependency on quality fine-tuning data, performance considerations for live traffic).]

## **5.5 Test and Validation**

[Describe the testing performed.]
*   **Unit Tests:** Mention that unit tests *should* be created for `rules.py` (testing individual rule logic), `feature_extractor.py` (testing feature extraction on known packet structures), and `llm_interface.py` (mocking model responses to test JSON parsing/validation). Refer to `tests/` directory (even if currently placeholder).
*   **Integration Tests:** Describe testing the `assess pcap` command with sample PCAP files containing known benign and malicious traffic (e.g., files from Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net, custom captures). Compare generated JSON reports against expected findings.
*   **Validation Metrics (LLM):** Discuss how the LLM's fine-tuning would ideally be validated using a hold-out test set (split from `finetuning_dataset.jsonl`). Metrics could include accuracy (did it identify `is_vulnerable` correctly?), BLEU/ROUGE scores (for description similarity, less relevant for JSON), and manual review of the generated JSON structure, severity, and mitigation steps for correctness and relevance. Note that resource constraints might limit extensive validation.

## **5.6 Summary**

*   Demonstration of using a small, efficient LLM (TinyLlama-1.1B) for a complex network security task.
*   Development of a hybrid system balancing speed (rules) and potential intelligence (LLM).
*   Creation of a pipeline for preparing security data (vulnerability info, mitigations) for LLM fine-tuning.
*   A working prototype capable of identifying indicators related to the top 5 target vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, BoF, DoS/DDoS, MitM) based on rules and potentially the fine-tuned LLM.
*   Implementation optimized for lower resource usage compared to larger LLM approaches.

## **6.4 Project Applicability on Real-World Applications**

*   **Security Operations Center (SOC) Triage:** Assisting analysts by performing initial analysis on network alerts or PCAPs, providing context and potential mitigation paths.
*   **Incident Response:** Quickly analyzing suspect PCAPs during an investigation to identify related malicious activity.
*   **Educational Tool:** Helping students learn about network vulnerabilities, detection techniques (rules/patterns), and mitigation strategies by seeing them applied.
*   **Resource-Constrained Environments:** Providing basic intelligent network analysis capabilities where deploying large security appliances or cloud services is not feasible.
*   **Custom Threat Detection:** The fine-tuning process allows adapting the LLM to detect organization-specific threats or policy violations if appropriate training data is created.

## **6.5 Inference**

[Conclude that the project successfully demonstrates the potential of using small, fine-tuned LLMs in a hybrid approach for network vulnerability assessment, offering a balance between performance, resource efficiency, and analytical capability, particularly relevant for common threat scenarios.]

# **CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS**

## **7.1 Outline**

[State that this chapter summarizes the project, discusses its limitations, and proposes directions for future work.]

## **7.2 Limitations/Constraints of the System**

*   **LLM Dependence on Fine-tuning:** The effectiveness of the LLM component is entirely dependent on the quality and scope of the fine-tuning data. The base TinyLlama model will perform poorly on this task.
*   **Scope Limitation:** Currently targets only 5 specific vulnerability categories. Many other network threats exist.
*   **Rule Engine Simplicity:** The default rules are basic examples; a production system needs a much more extensive and robust rule set, potentially integrated with threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Feature Extraction Limits:** Relies primarily on L2-L4 headers and basic payload snippets. Does not perform deep packet inspection or decryption of encrypted traffic (TLS/SSL).
*   **Resource Constraints Impact:** While optimized, running LLM inference (even TinyLlama) on every packet in high-throughput live traffic is likely still too slow on low-end hardware. Fine-tuning locally remains challenging on 8GB RAM.
*   **LLM Hallucination/Accuracy:** LLMs can still generate incorrect or irrelevant information ("hallucinate"), requiring validation of findings. JSON output format might not always be perfect.
*   **Live Capture Permissions:** Requires elevated privileges, which may not always be available.

## **7.3 Future Enhancements**

*   **Expand Vulnerability Coverage:** Fine-tune the LLM and add rules for a wider range of vulnerabilities (e.g., specific malware C&C, RCE exploits, reconnaissance techniques).
*   **Improve Feature Extraction:** Implement flow analysis (tracking connections over multiple packets), extract features from encrypted traffic (e.g., JA3/JA3S hashes for TLS fingerprinting), add basic HTTP/other L7 protocol parsing.
*   **Advanced Rule Engine:** Integrate with external rule formats (Snort, Suricata, Sigma), allow dynamic rule loading, incorporate threat intelligence feeds for IPs/domains.
*   **Database Integration:** Store findings in a database (e.g., SQLite, Elasticsearch) for historical analysis, searching, and dashboarding (implementing the `reports list` command).
*   **Performance Optimization:** Explore optimized inference servers (Triton, vLLM), further model quantization (GPTQ, AWQ), or hardware acceleration if deployed on capable systems. Implement packet sampling or flow-based analysis for high-speed live capture.
*   **GUI/Web Interface:** Develop a graphical interface for easier interaction, visualization of findings, and report management.
*   **API Development:** Expose the analysis capabilities via an API for integration with other security tools (SIEM, SOAR).
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Incorporate asset information or network topology data to provide more context-aware risk assessment and mitigation advice.
*   **Explainability:** Investigate methods to provide better explanations for why the LLM flagged certain traffic (if possible with current models).

## **7.4 Inference**

[Conclude the entire report. Reiterate the successful demonstration of the hybrid, resource-aware approach. Acknowledge the limitations but emphasize the potential of fine-tuned small LLMs as a valuable component in the network security toolkit. Suggest that future work focusing on data quality, feature engineering, and optimized deployment can further enhance its practical applicability.]
